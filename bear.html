        <h2>Dislikes</h2>
        <p>Bear dislikes many things, including types of objects and sounds.</p>
        <h3>Objects</h3>
        <p>The objects she dislikes fall into two main categories- inanimate and animate objects.</p>
        <h4>Inanimate Objects</h4>
        <p>Bear is very thrown off by objects that should not move that inexplicably do, most startlingly when they move
            in her direction.</p>
        <h4>Animate Objects</h4>
        <p>Bear is also not fond of objects that are supposed to move, including Roombas. Once again, the startling
            effect is amplified when they move in her direction.</p>
